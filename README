## README

This project includes a PHP class named `PrettyPrint` that can be used to print data in a visually appealing way. The class has the following methods:

- `__construct()`: Loads the CSS and JavaScript files needed for the pretty print.
- `print()`: Prints the data in a visually appealing way.
- `printAndDie()`: Prints the data in a visually appealing way and terminates the script.
- `getLine($type, $value)`: Returns a formatted line of data.
- `getValue($arg)`: Returns the formatted value of a data type.
- `processLine($arg, $key = null)`: Processes a line of data and returns the formatted output.

To use the `PrettyPrint` class, you can create an instance of the class and call the `print()` or `printAndDie()` method with the data you want to print. The class will format the data and print it in a visually appealing way.
